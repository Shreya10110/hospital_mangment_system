"""
logger.py — Application-wide logging configuration.

Provides a single factory, :func:`logger`, that returns a named logger writing
to both the console and ``logs/debug.log``. Every module obtains its logger the
same way, which keeps log formatting consistent and makes each record traceable
back to the module that emitted it.

Usage:
    >>> from core import logger
    >>> logging = logger(__name__)
    >>> logging.info("User created")

Record format:
    ``[pid=<pid>] - [timestamp] - [module] - [LEVEL] - [message]``

    The process id matters once the application runs under multiple workers:
    interleaved records from concurrent processes can otherwise be impossible to
    separate.

Note:
    ``logs/`` is excluded from version control. Log files are runtime artefacts,
    and they routinely contain data that must not be committed.

Warning:
    Never log credentials, password hashes, tokens, or OTP codes. Logs are
    copied, forwarded to aggregators, and read by people who are not authorised
    to see that material.

    """
    Build a file handler that appends records to ``<save_path>/<log_name>``.

    The destination directory is created if it does not exist, so a fresh
    checkout runs without any manual setup.

    Args:
        log_name: File name to write to, e.g. ``"debug.log"``.
        mode: Minimum level this handler records, e.g. :data:`logging.DEBUG`.
            Named ``mode`` for historical reasons; it is a level, not a file
            mode.
        formatter: Formatter controlling the layout of each record.
        save_path: Directory for the log file. Defaults to ``"logs"``, resolved
            relative to the process's working directory.

    Returns:
        logging.FileHandler: A configured handler, not yet attached to a logger.

    Note:
        Records are appended, never truncated, so history survives a restart.
        The file grows without bound — a deployed service should rotate it, for
        example with :class:`logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler`.

    Attach a console handler and a debug file handler to a logger.

    Both handlers share one formatter, so a record reads identically on screen
    and on disk.

    Args:
        logger: The logger instance to configure. Modified in place.
        debug_mode: Reserved for toggling verbosity. Currently unused; the
            logger is always configured at :data:`logging.DEBUG`.

    Returns:
        logging.Logger: The same instance, now carrying both handlers.

    Warning:
        Handlers are added unconditionally. Calling this twice for the same
        logger name attaches a second pair and each record is then emitted
        twice. Obtain loggers only through :func:`logger`, once per module at
        import time.
